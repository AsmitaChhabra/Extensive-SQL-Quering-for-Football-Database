We plan to analyze and support extensive querying and exploration for a football database sourced from
Transfermarkt. The dataset is composed of multiple CSV files with information on competitions, games,
clubs, players, and appearances.
The objective of this project is to develop a football analytics window using Python's Tkinter for the
user interface and a MySQL database for backend data storage. This tool enables users to interactively
analyze, search, and visualize various aspects of football players' and clubs' performance, market
behavior, and career trajectories.
